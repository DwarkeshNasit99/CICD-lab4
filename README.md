## ðŸŽ‰ Your Azure CI/CD Pipeline Lab is Complete!

I've created a complete Azure Function project with CI/CD pipeline that meets all the assignment requirements. Here's what you have:

###  Project Structure
- **`HelloWorldFunction/`** - C# Azure Function App with HTTP trigger
- **`HelloWorldFunction.Tests/`** - Unit tests for the function
- **`azure-pipelines.yml`** - Complete CI/CD pipeline with Build, Test, and Deploy stages
- **`SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed step-by-step instructions
- **`README.md`** - Project documentation
- **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore file for .NET projects

###  Pipeline Features
The `azure-pipelines.yml` includes all required stages:

1. **Build Stage (1.5%)**: 
   - Installs .NET 6 SDK
   - Restores NuGet packages
   - Builds the function app
   - Creates deployment package

2. **Test Stage (1.5%)**:
   - Runs unit tests
   - Publishes test results
   - Collects code coverage

3. **Deploy Stage (2%)**:
   - Downloads build artifacts
   - Deploys to Azure Function App

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Follow the `SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - This contains detailed step-by-step instructions for:
   - Creating your GitHub repository
   - Setting up Azure DevOps
   - Creating Azure resources
   - Running the pipeline
   - Verifying deployment

2. **Key Files to Customize**:
   - In `azure-pipelines.yml`, update:
     - `functionAppName` with your actual Function App name
     - `azureSubscription` with your service connection name

3. **Submission Requirements**:
   - GitHub Repository URL
   - Azure Function URL
   - Screenshots of pipeline execution

### ðŸ”§ What the Function Does
The Azure Function returns a JSON response with:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World!",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "functionName": "HelloWorld"
}
```

### ðŸ“– How to Proceed
1. Open `SETUP_GUIDE.md` and follow the instructions step by step
2. The guide includes troubleshooting tips and common issues
3. All code is ready to deploy - just follow the setup steps

The lab is designed to meet all grading criteria:
- âœ… Build Stage (1.5%): Successful compilation and packaging
- âœ… Test Stage (1.5%): Running automated unit tests  
- âœ… Deploy Stage (2%): Successful deployment to Azure Function App

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the setup or help you with the next steps?
